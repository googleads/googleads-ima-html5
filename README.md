## Google Ads HTML5 IMA SDK

This project hosts samples for the
[HTML5 IMA SDK](//developers.google.com/interactive-media-ads/docs/sdks/html5/client-side).

### Samples Breakdown

*   [Simple](https://github.com/googleads/googleads-ima-html5/tree/main/simple) -
    the bare minimum required for an IMA integration
*   [Advanced](https://github.com/googleads/googleads-ima-html5/tree/main/advanced) -
    IMA integration with more advanced UI including event logging, play/pause,
    and fullscreen, and companion ads
*   [Playlist](https://github.com/googleads/googleads-ima-html5/tree/main/playlist) -
    expands on the advanced sample to demonstrate an integration with a video
    playlist
*   [Audio in video](https://github.com/googleads/googleads-ima-html5/tree/main/audio_in_video) -
    demonstrates the use of the
    [poster image feature](https://developers.google.com/interactive-media-ads/docs/sdks/html5/client-side/audio-poster)
    in an app that supports either audio or video ads.
*   [VPAID](https://github.com/googleads/googleads-ima-html5/tree/main/vpaid) -
    these JavaScript samples are used in the
    [IMA VPAID sample ad tags](https://developers.google.com/interactive-media-ads/docs/sdks/html5/client-side/tags#single-vpaid-2.0-linear).
    The code in these samples is needed in VPAID ads, but not in IMA
    implementations for VPAID ads. For more information on VPAID ads, see the
    [IAB VPAID docs](https://iabtechlab.com/standards/video-player-ad-interface-definition-vpaid/).
